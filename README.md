This repository contains different notebooks:
* Mnist dataset classification using NN and CNN and comparing between both methods, the data set has a pictures of digits that needs to be classified between 0 and 9.
* Mnist dataset classification using CNN.
* Image Augmentation notebook that shows one way of manipulating images to enhance CNNs.
* VGG16 which is the model created by Visual Geometry Group at Oxford University which won the 2004, in this competition the model has to recognize 1000 categories of images, i downloaded the weights from the author's GitHub so not to create and train the whole VGG16 from scratch as it will need so many days and GPUs.
